This is a collection of sample files, tutorials, and relevant examples of using Matplotlib.  A few are all original including the
file Spreadsheet Data Animation which was part of a large application to process large .csv files to create charts
and perform calculation on process information.  The animation slowed as it ran longer (until it recycled to the beginning).  I was unable
to improve this issue and posted this code on StackOverflow in hopes of finding a solution.

The file Matplotlib_tutorial_new_think_tank is from NewThinkTank.Com and contains numerous examples with a few modifications. 
This is an excellant collection of sample charts and tables.  The file Table_Class is an obect oriented version from that tutorial
that can be used as a generic table generator.
